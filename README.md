# Weather forecast app ðŸŒž

This project was built based on the idea of https://devchallenges.io/. 
After a lot of JavaScript practice I wanted to do something more significant than a "Hello World" project.
I was looking for a more complex task where I could try what I had learned.

## Intro ðŸ“„

*Weather app* is based on Create React App. It uses an external data source, an *API* to fetch weather data. Thanks to the *responsiveness*, the forecast for the next 5 days is perfectly visible on both mobile and desktop.

Most of the UI design is taken from *devchallenges*, with some changes that I wanted to make. (Such as moving the search to another page so I can practice using `react-router`.) All the CSS is hand-written without the use of a CSS framework or preprocessor, and I am utilizing *CSS modules* to make sure my classnames don't collide.

## Technologies used âš™
- React 17
- Create React App
- CSS Modules
- React Router
- The `classnames` utility
- SWR
